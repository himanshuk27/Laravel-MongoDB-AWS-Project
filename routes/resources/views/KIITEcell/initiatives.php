										Maker’s Lab is our newest initiative. Through this, we want to set up an incubation space for startups where they can come and work together. We will also be providing them with proper guidance of mentors, required technological support, and the proper resources. This would act as a platform to help generate successful startups from the university in the future.

This unique platform ensures that the students get the most out of the event (Internship Camp), in the form of Internships which can boost their CVs to another level.
